{{ $NEXT }}

0.13      2018-02-03 11:28:16-06:00 America/Chicago

  [Added]

  - Added `list_locks` method so that the Minion admin UI works. Thanks
    @pentabion! [Github #17]

0.12      2018-01-14 01:22:07-06:00 America/Chicago

  [Fixed]

  - Fixed all the missing features from the backend to fully-support
    Minion 8.

0.11      2017-11-18 13:43:48-06:00 America/Chicago

  [Fixed]

  - Upgraded backend to work with Minion 8 and the Minion admin UI

  - Allow hashref of options to Mojo::mysql. This lets us pass in a full
    DBI connection string to use options not normally available via the
    `mysql://` URL string.

0.10      2017-11-05 19:12:38-06:00 America/Chicago

  [Fixed]

  - Fixed tests to only run on MySQL 5.6.5 or higher. Versions older
    than this do not support the `TIMESTAMP` column settings we are
    using. Thanks @paultcochrane!

  - Fixed tests to report which MySQL version is running so we can more
    easily detect why database queries are failing. Thanks
    @paultcochrane!

  - Fixed travis reporting coverage to coveralls. Thanks @paultcochrane!

  - Removed some whitespace-only POD lines which `podchecker` was
    complaining about. Thanks @paultcochrane!

    - Partial support for Minion 7.0
        - Automatic job retry
        - Worker commands
        - Missing features: job parents, locking, job notes
      This is enough to boot Minion and run basic jobs. Any jobs that
      depend on unimplemented features may not work correctly, and may
      cause errors.
